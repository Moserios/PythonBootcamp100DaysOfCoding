# CRUD Operations with SQLAlchemy
# Hopefully, you figured out how to solve the challenge from the last lesson, as a review,
# here's a summary of some of the things we did:
#
# Create a New Database
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String, Float

app = Flask(__name__)


class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass


app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = "sqlite:///<name of database>.db"
db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)
db.init_app(app)


# As of flask-sqlalchemy version 3.1, you need to pass a subclass of DeclarativeBase to the constructor of the database.


# Create a New Table
# Next we define and create the model. What is the : used for? Explicitly declaring a variable type.
# Below we are explicitly saying that id is of type Mapped.
# SQLAlchemy uses the generic Mapped so that it can type check the data that will be stored in the database.

class Book(db.Model):
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(250), unique=True, nullable=False)
    author: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(250), nullable=False)
    rating: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(Float, nullable=False)


with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()

# In addition to these things, the most crucial thing to figure out when working with any new database technology
# is how to CRUD data records.
#
# Create
#
# Read
#
# Update
#
# Delete

# So, let's go through each of these using SQLite and SQLAlchemy:
# Create A New Record

with app.app_context():
    new_book = Book(id=1, title="Harry Potter", author="J. K. Rowling", rating=9.3)
    db.session.add(new_book)
    db.session.commit()
# NOTE: When creating new records, the primary key fields is optional. you can also write:

new_book = Book(title="Harry Potter", author="J. K. Rowling", rating=9.3)

# the id field will be auto-generated.

# Read All Records

with app.app_context():
    result = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).order_by(Book.title))
    all_books = result.scalars()

# To read all the records we first need to create a "query" to select things from the database.
# When we execute a query during a database session we get back the rows in the database (a Result object).
# We then use scalars() to get the individual elements rather than entire rows.


# Read A Particular Record By Query
with app.app_context():
    book = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.title == "Harry Potter")).scalar()

# To get a single element we can use scalar() instead of scalars().


# Update A Particular Record By Query
with app.app_context():
    book_to_update = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.title == "Harry Potter")).scalar()
    book_to_update.title = "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
    db.session.commit()

# Update A Record By PRIMARY KEY
book_id = 1
with app.app_context():
    book_to_update = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.id == book_id)).scalar()
    # or book_to_update = db.get_or_404(Book, book_id)  
    book_to_update.title = "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"
    db.session.commit()
# Flask-SQLAlchemy also has some handy extra query methods like get_or_404() that we can use.
# Since Flask-SQLAlchemy version 3.0 the previous query methods like Book.query.get() have been deprecated

# Delete A Particular Record By PRIMARY KEY

book_id = 1
with app.app_context():
    book_to_delete = db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.id == book_id)).scalar()
    # or book_to_delete = db.get_or_404(Book, book_id)
    db.session.delete(book_to_delete)
    db.session.commit()

# You can also delete by querying for a particular value e.g. by title or one of the other properties.
# Again, the get_or_404() method is quite handy.
